<h1>Image to ASCII Generator</h1> 
<a href="https://skillicons.dev"> <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python"/> </a>

<p> This program takes a picture as a command line argument and outputs the picture in the form of ASCII characters. The original image is first turned into greyscale and then has each pixel turned into an ASCII character (@, #, S, %, ?, *, +, ;, :, ,, .) depending on its brightness level. </p>
